I am excited to announce my preprint titled **Compositional perturbation autoencoder for single-cell response modeling**
is not out! This is the work from my time at FACEBOOK AI. 

The preprint is available on [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.14.439903v1). 

Here is the blog postsfrom [FACEBOOK AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-predicts-effective-drug-combinations-to-fight-complex-diseases-faster) explaining the method.
The code can also be found in [github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CPA?fbclid=IwAR2g1C6lt547qKdiiAMQC-A2RQfgiaR-8V8bHSKmAWk48WyxyE0R5lf9N0A).
